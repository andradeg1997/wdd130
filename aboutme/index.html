            <h2>Gabriel de Andrade</h2>
            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Gabriel, and I live in Curitiba, Brazil. I'm 25, I got married three years ago, and I already have a beautiful two years old daughter called Helena. I am fascinated by meeting new people and helping them protect and even multiply their wealth. I have the privilege of working as a financial advisor at some of the country's leading financial institutions.
                I've been a member of the church since always. My mom met the sister's missionaries when she was about 17. I served as a missionary from 2015 to 2017 at Brazil Brasilia Mission, and now my church calling is to serve as a member of the Stake High Council.
